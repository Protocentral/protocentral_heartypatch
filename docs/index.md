## The HeartyPatch App for Android - BETA

An android app for HeartyPatch is now available that receives and displays the real-time heart rate as well as HRV trends and variables. The app scans for any HeartyPatch devices in the vicinity and shows a list of devices accessible through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). Please note that you would need an Android device with BLE support to use this app.

You can download and install the app from the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.protocentral.heartypatch) in the following link:

[![HeartyPatch App for Android](images/google-play-badge.png)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.protocentral.heartypatch)

*Note: The android app for HeartyPatch is still in BETA and there might be some instability as a result.*

*Note: HeartyPatch can also be used with any Android app that supports the heart-rate profile.*

# Modes of operation

HeartyPatch at any time can work in only ONE of the following modes. Wi-Fi and BLE do not work together as of now.

## Bluetooth LE Mode
With the preloaded firmware, the HeartyPatch will do heart-rate and R-R interval measurement and send it over BLE through a standard [Heart-rate BLE service](https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/viewer?attributeXmlFile=org.bluetooth.service.heart_rate.xml), as well as a separate custom HRV service that will provide parameters used for HRV analysis such as SD, Mean RR, PNN50 and SDNN.

## Continuous ECG Streaming mode over WiFi/TCP

The HeartyPatch can also do live ECG streaming from the chest. This works similar to a heart-rate monitor. Below is a screen capture of the device working in ECG mode. The data is sent over a TCP socket over WiFi. To get the WiFi mode turned on, you will have to [flash a different firmware onto the device](#continuous-ecg-streaming-mode-over-wifitcp).

# Compiling your own firmware (advanced, optional)

The firmware for the HeartyPatch's on-board Espressif ESP32 chip uses the [esp-idf framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf)
 for development. You will need to install and configure the following components to setup a development environment:

* **The Xtensa ESP32 toolchain**
  Please make sure to download the toolchain from the [Espressif Setup Guide for v2.1](http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/v2.1/get-started/index.html#standard-setup-of-toolchain)

  This version of the esp-idf compiles well only with the toolchain version 1.22.0-61-gab8375a-5.2.0.

* **The v2.1 release of esp-idf**
  *The current version of the HeartyPatch code compiles well and performs well only with v2.1 of the ESP-IDF and version 1.22.0-61-gab8375a-5.2.0 of the Xtensa toolchain.*

  [Download the ESP-IDF version 2.1 here](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/releases/download/v2.1/esp-idf-v2.1.zip)

  Setup guides for these components are available on the [ESP-IDF documentation site](https://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/v2.1/get-started/index.html).

* Clone our [Github repository](https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_heartypatch) of code for the ESP32:

  `git clone https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_heartypatch.git`

  [or download a zip file of the latest master branch](https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_heartypatch/archive/master.zip).

* Download this zip file, rename it to whatever you want to. Change to this directory and then start building.

`Please make sure that correct version of all of the above tools are installed before proceeding.`

The folder "heartypatch-ble" in the "Firmware" contains the code for the preloaded firmware on the HeartyPatch, which calculates R-R interval, heart rate and time domain parameters for HRV analysis and sends them through BLE.

Now that you have the code and ready to build, you will need to configure the build options for heartypatch through menuconfig utility:

* Open the terminal and navigate to the folder which contains the heartypatch code 	
* Start the project configuration utility **menuconfig**     		
  `make menuconfig`

  ![menuconfig](images/makemenuconfig.png)

* Configure your serial port under *Serial flasher config -> Default serial port*

  ![port](images/serialport.png)

* Use the *Heartypatch configuration* to enable BLE mode

  ![heartypatch-config](images/heartypatch-config-ble.png)

BLE mode at this time does not support ECG stream since the MAX30003 sensor is configured for R-R detection only. By enabling the wifi, you may get hr and rr values through TCP in the Heartypatch GUI. For ECG stream you may use the heartypatch-stream-tcp code [protocentral-heartypatch/firmware/heatypatch-stream-tcp]

* Navigate to component config -> esp32-specific ->main XTAL frequency and select 26 Mhz as the board crystal

  ![Setting crystal freqency](images/xtal-frequency.png)

* Save the configuration by selecting `<save>` and close menuconfig

* Run the makefile (assuming previous steps are done correctly):

  `make` or `make -j5`

* To flash the firmware on to the board, just use:

  `make flash`

  If the flashing is successful, you should see something similar to the below screen:

  ![ESP Success](images/esp-flash-success.png)

# Continuous ECG mode

The folder `heartypatch-stream-tcp` contains the code for streaming ECG.

Before flashing this code, enable wifi, TCP and mdns through `makemenuconfig` similar to the process described in the previous section.

* Start makemenuconfig and navigate to *Heartypatch configuration*, set your wifi ssid and password, enable mdns and TCP:
  ![Heartypatch config](images/heartypatch-config-tcp.png)

* Configure the serial port under Serial flasher config -> Default serial port
* Navigate to *Component config -> esp32-specific ->main XTAL frequency* and select 26 MHz as the board crystal

Run the makefile (assuming previous steps are done correctly):

`make` or `make -j5`

To flash the firmware on to the board, just use:

`make flash`

If the flashing is successful, you should see something similar to the below screen:

![ESP Success](images/esp-flash-success.png)

You can open the IDF monitor to see the debug messages by using the command:

`make monitor`

![idf-monitor](images/idf-monitor-tcp-connection.png)

Once the heartypatch is connected with the wifi, open the gui from the project folder and you should be able see the ECG stream.  

More information about this process and the ESP32 framework is available in the [ESP32 Get Started Guide](http://esp-idf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/get-started/).

# The TCP Client GUI

The HeartyPatch is now configured as a TCP sever ready for connection from a TCP client. The HeartyPatch sends data out in the following packet format.

| Offset| Byte Value  | Description|
------  | ----------- | -----------
| 0     | 0x0A | Start of frame
| 1     | 0xFA | Start of frame
| 2     | Payload Size LSB |
| 3     | Payload Size MSB |
| 4     | Protocol version | (currently 0x03)
|5-8    | Packet sequence | incremental number
|9-16   | Timestamp | From ESP32 gettimeofday()
|17-20  | R-R Interval |
|18-... | ECG Data samples | Currently 8 samples / packet|
|...    | 0x0B | End of Frame|


You can download the ProtoCentral TCP client GUI for your platform from the following link.

[Download TCP Client GUI](https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_heartypatch/releases/latest)

After you unzip and run the executable program on your computer, choose the default address (heartypatch.local) and click connect. You should see a screen like this:

# Frequently Asked Questions

* **Why is the heart-rate not stable? There's always variation.**

  Do not worry, that's what is [Heart-rate variability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_rate_variability) and HeartyPatch displays real-time beat-to-beat heart rate. Heart-rate is supposed to vary from beat-to-beat.

* **How do I get the full ECG signal from the device?**

  Please read our [Guide to program the device the TCP Streaming mode](#continuous-ecg-mode)

* **I have problems getting the code to compile. What do I do?**

  Most of the problems in compilation arise from having the wrong versions of the ESP-IDF. Please make sure the versions of the esp-idf as well as the Xtensa toochain match the ones given in out [Guide to firmware upgrades](#updating-the-firmware)

* **Help, there is not LED flashing on the device.**

  By default, the LED would not flash. This is done to conserve battery power. This can be enabled in the software though.

* **Why is the ECG  signal too noisy?**

  Noise is very common in ECG systems and they usually use filters to take them out. The HeartyPatch already has hardware as well as software filters to remove noise. However, there are still some conditions which can cause the signal to be noisy:

    * Contact is key. Make sure that the electrode pad is fully flat on the body and it is positioned properly.
    * Make sure that the position of the HeartyPatch is correct (refer to the video). Other positions may not provide a strong signal
    * Do not use the HeartyPatch on the body while it is connected to the USB cable. Always remove the cable before wearing the HeartyPatch.
    * A common source of noise is dry skin. Dry skin does not give good electrical conductivity.
    * Do not re-use ECG electrodes. The quality of contact would reduce with each use.

*We will continue to add to this list based on user input, so please check this list if something goes wrong.*
